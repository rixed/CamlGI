synopsis: "OCaml (F)CGI library"
description: """
CamlGI supports multiple connections and multiplexed requests.
You can execute those concurrently with the model of your choice
(unix fork, threads,...).

This library is mostly compatible with the Cgi library of mod_caml
so porting programs between the two is fairly straightforward.
